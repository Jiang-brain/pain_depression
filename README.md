The association between pain conditions and incident depression

A series of Cox proportional hazards regression models were implemented to estimate the association of pain conditions across eight body sites and pain status with the risk of depression incidence, using the follow-up time as the underlying timescale. The analyses used PF individuals as the reference group and adjusted for 13 covariates including age, sex, race, material deprivation, educational attainment, household income, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, sedentary behaviour, BMI category, and history of cancer, vascular or heart problems, and diabetes.

Results were reported as hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). The potential non-linearity was formally examined by introducing a restricted cubic spline into the Cox models. All analyses were performed using a 5-year landmark analysis to minimize a possible reverse causality by excluding participants experiencing events at baseline or within the first 5-year follow-up period. The proportional hazard assumption was checked using Schoenfeld residuals and no violation was found. We examined the modifying effect of all covariates on the association by including a multiplicative interaction term. Then, stratified analyses were performed by covariates showing significant interaction effects.
